# Big Data Visual Analytics (CS661A) 

## Welcome to the Adventure!

Embarking on the journey of Big Data Visual Analytics, Group 72, consisting of **Nitish Kumar** and **Manish Agrawal**, tackled a series of assignments that tested not just our coding skills, but also our patience, creativity, and our ability to laugh at 3 AM bugs.

## Assignment 1 - The Great Isocontour Hunt üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Group Member 1:
- **Name:** Nitish Kumar
- **Roll No:** 231110033
- **Dept.:** M.Tech (C.S.E)

### Group Member 2:
- **Name:** Manish Agrawal
- **Roll No:** 231110028
- **Dept.:** M.Tech (C.S.E)

### Libraries Used:
- VTK

*(If VTK isn‚Äôt installed yet, don't worry, we've got your back. Just open the command prompt and type `pip install vtk`. It‚Äôs like getting your passport stamped for the journey ahead.)*

### Steps to Run Assignment:

1. **Unzip the Adventure:**
   Extract the `"Assignment1.zip"` in your local system. It‚Äôs like unpacking your bags for the trip.

2. **Meet the Crew:**
   Inside, you'll find the Data folder with `Isabel_2D.vti`, `Isabel_3D.vti`, a PDF file `Assignment_1`, Python source files `Q1.py` and `Q2.py` (our trusty sidekicks), this README.md file, and the output file `vtkpolydata1.vtp` (our trophy!).

3. **Command Prompt - Your Map:**
   Open the command prompt by typing "cmd" in the address bar at the top of your window. It‚Äôs your map to navigate through the adventure.
   - For **Question 1**, type `python Q1.py`. When prompted, enter the isovalue (think of it as choosing the difficulty level in a game) and hit enter. Voil√†! The isocontour is generated and saved as `vtkpolydata1.vtp`.
   - For **Question 2**, type `python Q2.py`. You‚Äôll be asked if you want Phong shading‚Äîthink of it as choosing between HD and SD. Choose wisely, and your output will look either dazzling or...well, let‚Äôs say, retro.

4. **Pro Tip:** If you‚Äôre feeling adventurous and want to run the code on a different file, just update the file path in the code. It‚Äôs like taking a detour in your adventure.

## Assignment 2 - The Plot Thickens üìä

### Group Member 1:
- **Name:** Nitish Kumar
- **Roll No:** 231110033
- **Dept.:** M.Tech (C.S.E)

### Group Member 2:
- **Name:** Manish Agrawal
- **Roll No:** 231110028
- **Dept.:** M.Tech (C.S.E)

### Libraries Used:
- VTK
- Numpy
- Plotly

*(If these libraries aren‚Äôt installed, you know the drill! Command prompt, `pip install --library_name`, and you‚Äôre ready to roll.)*

### Steps to Run the Assignment:

1. **Unzip and Explore:**
   Extract the `"Assignment2.zip"` in your local system. Think of it as unwrapping a mystery box‚Äîwhat‚Äôs inside could change your life‚Ä¶ or just make your day.

2. **Inside the Box:**
   You‚Äôll find `mixture.vti`, a PDF file `Assignment_2`, Python source file `Assignment_2.ipynb`, and this README.md file.

3. **Start Your Engines:**
   Open the command prompt, type `jupyter notebook`, and hit enter. This is where the magic happens. Think of it as firing up the Batmobile.

4. **Run the Show:**
   Click on `Assignment2.ipynb` and follow the instructions. It‚Äôs as easy as following the GPS‚Äîexcept this one actually takes you where you want to go.

### Libraries Used:
- VTK
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Plotly

*(Missing any of these? A quick `pip install --library_name` will save the day.)*

### Steps to Run the Assignment:

1. **Unzip - One Last Time:**
   Extract the `"Assignment3.zip"` in your local system. This is the final leg of our journey‚Äîmake sure you‚Äôre ready!

2. **What‚Äôs Inside:**
   The folder contains `tornado3d_vector.vti`, a PDF file `Assignment3`, Python source file `Assignment_3.ipynb`, `streamline.vtp`, and this README.md file.

3. **Fire Up the Command Prompt:**
   Type `jupyter notebook` in the command prompt and press enter. The notebook is your stage, and it‚Äôs time to shine.

4. **Enter the Coordinates:**
   After running the second cell, you‚Äôll be asked to enter x, y, and z coordinates. Enter `0, 0, 7`‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt just a random combination, it‚Äôs the key to unlocking the exact diagram mentioned in the assignment. Trust us, we‚Äôve tested it!

## Closing Thoughts ü§î

And there you have it‚Äîa journey through the landscapes of Big Data Visual Analytics, peppered with challenges, laughter, and a few too many cups of coffee. Whether you're here to review our work or to take inspiration for your own, we hope you enjoyed the ride as much as we did.

Happy coding!

*P.S. If you‚Äôre ever up late fighting bugs, remember‚Äîyou‚Äôre not alone. Somewhere, Nitish and Manish are probably doing the same. Cheers!*
